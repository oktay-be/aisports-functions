# European Sports News Processing Prompt for Claude 4

## OBJECTIVE
Process and analyze European sports news data from a journ4list scraping session. Transform the raw data into a clean, deduplicated, summarized, and precisely classified JSON dataset.

## INPUT DATA
You will receive a JSON file containing scraped European sports news articles with the following structure:
- `articles`: Array of news articles with fields like `url`, `title`, `body`, `published_at`, `source`, `keywords_used`

## PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. DEDUPLICATION

  - Identical or very similar titles (≥90% similarity)
  - Same URL or same content body
  - Same core story but from different URLs
- Keep the most complete version (with most content) when duplicates are found
- Log how many duplicates were removed

### 2. DATA CLEANING
- Remove articles with missing or empty `title` and `body` fields
- Clean up repeated content within article bodies (remove excessive repetition)
- Normalize special characters and encoding issues
- Remove navigation elements, advertisements, and non-news content from body text

### 3. SUMMARIZATION
- Create a comprehensive summary that preserves all important information (no strict sentence limit)
- Include ALL key details: player names, team names, transfer amounts, dates, sources, quotes
- Capture the main news event, supporting details, and context
- Preserve important details like monetary amounts, dates, official statements, and background information
- Maintain factual accuracy while condensing repetitive or redundant content
- Ensure no critical information is lost during the summarization process
